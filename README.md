# Cortexa: My Friendly Local AI Chat Assistant

Cortexa is a responsive and intuitive AI chat application designed to demonstrate the capabilities of locally hosted large language models. This project features a clean web interface, built HTML, CSS and JS, backed by a Node.js Express server. The server orchestrates communication with a local Ollama instance running the tinyllama:chat LLM, providing an entirely self-contained AI chat experience.

This project emphasizes local-first AI, allowing users to experience the power of large language models without relying on external cloud services, ensuring privacy and faster response times.

  ## üõ°Ô∏è Backend Security 
The backend is built with key security practices to ensure stability and protect the API:

- Strict CORS Policy: The API is configured to only accept requests from a specific, whitelisted frontend origin, preventing unauthorized cross-site access.
- Rate Limiting: Protects against abuse and brute-force attacks by limiting the number of API requests allowed from a single IP address.
- Input Validation: All incoming prompts are validated to ensure they are a non-empty string and do not exceed a maximum length in order to prevent type-related errors and to prevent oversized payloads.
